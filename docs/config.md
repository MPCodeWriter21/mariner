# Configuration
Mariner stores its configuration in ~/.config/mariner/config.yml. You can edit the file to change the default behavior.

At the moment, there are only three settings available:
- `download_path` - Path to the download directory
- `default_tracker` - Default tracker used for searching.
- `results` - The number of results shown.
