# Configuration

Mariner stores its configuration in ~/.config/mariner/config.yml. For different location, use the `--config-file` flag. You can edit the file to change the default behavior.

At the moment, there are only four settings available:

- `download_path` - Path to the download directory
- `default_tracker` - Default tracker used for searching.
- `results` - The number of results shown.
- `timeout` - Timeout for tracker requests.
